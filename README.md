Got it 🚀 — you want a professional **README.md** for your **Customer Churn Prediction Project** to showcase on GitHub.
Here’s a clean and developer-friendly version you can directly use in your repo:

# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a customer is likely to **churn (leave)** or **stay** based on their behavior and subscription details.  
The project includes a **Streamlit web application** for interactive predictions and supports **CSV file uploads** for batch predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Predict customer churn using a pre-trained ML model.  
- ✅ Upload CSV files and get churn predictions for multiple customers.  
- ✅ Data preprocessing with **scaler** and **imputer** for consistent results.  
- ✅ Interactive **Streamlit web interface** with a custom background.  
- ✅ Highlights customers predicted to churn.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Joblib** (for saving/loading models)
- **Streamlit** (for the web app)
- **PIL / Base64** (for background image handling)

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-prediction.git
   cd churn-prediction
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open in browser**
   Streamlit will give you a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) where you can interact with the app.

## 📊 Input Data Format

Your CSV file must contain the following columns:

* `CustomerID`
* `Age`
* `Tenure`
* `Usage Frequency`
* `Support Calls`
* `Payment Delay`
* `Total Spend`
* `Last Interaction`
* `Gender_Male`
* `Subscription Type_Premium`
* `Subscription Type_Standard`
* `Contract Length_Monthly`
* `Contract Length_Quarterly`

Example:

```csv
CustomerID,Age,Tenure,Usage Frequency,Support Calls,Payment Delay,Total Spend,Last Interaction,Gender_Male,Subscription Type_Premium,Subscription Type_Standard,Contract Length_Monthly,Contract Length_Quarterly
C001,35,12,20,2,0,1200,10,1,0,1,1,0
C002,42,8,15,5,1,850,5,0,1,0,0,1
```

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add support for **real-time single customer input form**.
* Display **charts/graphs** for churn analysis.
* Improve the model with **advanced algorithms** (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.).
* Deploy on **Streamlit Cloud / AWS / Heroku** for public access.
